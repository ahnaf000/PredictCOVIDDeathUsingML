# PredictCOVIDDeathUsingML
In this project, I am using PyTorch to create a regression model that can predict how many deaths there will be for a WI census tract, given the number of people who have tested positive, broken down by age. The train.csv and test.csv files used for this task are based on this dataset: https://data.dhsgis.wi.gov/datasets/wi-dhs::covid-19-vaccination-data-by-census-tract
